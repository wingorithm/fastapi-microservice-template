<h1 align=center><strong>Fastapi Microservice Template</strong></h1>

A production-ready template to jumpstart your microservice projects using FastAPI. This repository provides a structured foundation inspired by real-world applications, so you can focus on building features instead of boilerplate.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This template is not a drop-in production deployment, but it‚Äôs built on production-grade principles (modular architecture, service discovery, API gateway, centralized config). It gives you a strong foundation to scale toward production.

## What's The Scenario?
you'll have 2 client entry endpoint

### 1st journey pokemon to trainer
client will ask our system to find random pokemon data follows by the possible trainer for it 
-> hit {gateway_url}/pokemons/get-data -> hit service-a -> hit service-b -> return to client  
//todo: gambar

### 2nd journey trainer to pokemon
client will ask our system to find random trainer data follows by the possible pokemon to tame
client -> hit {gateway_url}/trainers/get-data -> hit service-b -> hit service-a -> return to client  
//todo: gambar

## How to Setup?
This project is now structured using multiple docker-compose files to separate the core infrastructure from the application services. This is the practice for managing different service lifecycles and environments.
```shell
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml           # Application services (service_a, service_b, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.infra.yml     # Infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Consul, Registrator, Kong)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ postgres-init/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ init-multi-db.sh         # bootstrap file for Postgre
```

### 1. start the infrastructure stack
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d
```
ensure postgres, consul, kong, etc. to become healthy. otherwise try to restart specific container that still unhealthy.
> (‚ÑπÔ∏è) special case for the kong-bootstrap it is expected to stop running after database bootstrapping finish.

### 2. check bootstrap result
there are some bootstrapping that are going to make
1. postgres db and schema, ensure this following db and schema are exist
```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kong
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 35 tables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ microservice
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄservice_a
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄservice_b
```

### 3. Start the Application Services
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```
when every time service is starting... it will try to migrate the migrations using `alembic`. So table that we devine in code base will also created in the database.
before you can fully use the app endpoint, insert application's data in `postgres-init\example-data.sql`
> (‚ÑπÔ∏è) DO NOT change version data in `*/app/repository/migration/versions/*.py`, if you need to change the migration follow instruction at section 'How To Modify The Code?'

### 4. Setup & Inspect Consul Service Registry
consul provide web UI to interact with Consul, enter the web UI go to `http://localhost:8500/`. Then on tab /services you may see something like below
> using UI is not weak, it not just easier, but help us reduce human error üòé

don't forget to setup app config in consul kv - centralize configuration, you may also do it via UI

### 5. Finale; Setup Your Gateway
same like consul, our Kong gateway also provide intuitive web admin UI 
first create your services, add service-a to kong i setup like below
```json
{
  "name": "pokemon-service",
  "tags": null,
  "protocol": "http",
  "host": "service-a.service.consul",
  "path": "/service-a/",
  "port": 80
}
```
do the same to service-b
```json
{
  "name": "trainer-service",
  "tags": null,
  "protocol": "http",
  "host": "service-b.service.consul",
  "path": "/service-b/",
  "port": 80
}
```

after above configuration you'll get something like below:

Next setup your route, i make every request with `/pokemons` is redirected to `service-a` aka `pokemon-service`
```json
{
  "name": "pokemon-service-route",
  "service": {
    "id": "13202838-f1b8-43f0-b541-8a15acaac2d5"
  },
  "tags": [],
  "protocols": [
    "http"
  ],
  "paths": [
    "/pokemons"
  ]
}
```

do the same to service be every request with `/trainers` is redirected to `service-b` aka `trainer-service`
```json
{
  "name": "trainer-service-route",
  "service": {
    "id": "69b874d5-0b86-4292-8b81-563d64df37a4"
  },
  "tags": [],
  "protocols": [
    "http"
  ],
  "paths": [
    "/trainers"
  ]
}
```

after above configuration you'll get something like below:

## How To Modify The Code?
1. uv pip install -r requirements.txt

2. alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create pokemons table" -> app/repository/migration/versions/xxxx_xxxx_table.py

3. run the service `python main.py` -> table created
