<h1 align=center><strong>Fastapi Microservice Template</strong></h1>

A template to jumpstart your microservice projects using FastAPI. This repository provides a structured foundation inspired by real-world applications, so you can focus on building features instead of boilerplate.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This template is not a drop-in production deployment, but it‚Äôs built on production-grade principles (modular architecture, service discovery, API gateway, centralized config). It gives you a strong foundation to scale toward production.

## What's The Scenario?
we'll have two primary interaction flows, orchestrated through an API Gateway.

### 1st Scenario : Find a Trainer for a Pok√©mon
``` shell
Client -> GET {gateway_url}/pokemons/get-data -> Service-A -> Service-B -> Client
```
Workflow:
1. A client sends a GET request to `/pokemons/get-data` endpoint on the API Gateway.
2. The gateway routes the request to `service-a` (the Pok√©mon Service).
3. `service-a` fetches data for a random Pok√©mon.
4. `service-a` then calls `service-b` (the Trainer Service) to find a trainer who would be a good match for the selected Pok√©mon.
5. The combined Pok√©mon and Trainer data is aggregated and returned to the client. The response will look like below example

</p>

### 2nd Scenario: Find a Pok√©mon for a Trainer
``` shell
Client -> GET {gateway_url}/trainers/get-data -> Service-B -> Service-A -> Client
```
Workflow:
1. A client sends a GET request to `/trainers/get-data` endpoint on the API Gateway.
2. The gateway routes the request to `service-b` (the Trainer Service).
3. `service-b` fetches data for a random trainer.
4. `service-b` then calls `service-a` (the Pok√©mon Service) to find a Pok√©mon that fits the trainer's profile or specialty.
5. The combined Trainer and Pok√©mon data is aggregated and returned to the client. The response will look like below example

## How to Setup?
This project is now structured using multiple docker-compose files to separate the core infrastructure from the application services. This is the practice for managing different service lifecycles and environments.
```shell
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml           # Application services (service_a, service_b, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.infra.yml     # Infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Consul, Registrator, Kong)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ postgres-init/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ init-multi-db.sh         # bootstrap file for Postgres
```

### 1. Start the Infrastructure Stack
First, launch the infrastructure services like the database, service discovery, and API gateway.
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d
```
After that check all containers, ensure their healthiness.
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: The `kong-bootstrap` container is expected to run once to set up the database and then exit. Seeing it with a status of `Exited (0)` is normal.

### 2. Verify Database Initialization
The `postgres-init` script automatically creates the necessary databases and schemas. Connect to your PostgreSQL instance and verify that the following structure exists:
```plaintext
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kong
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ public
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 35 Kong's internal tables)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ microservice
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄservice_a
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄservice_b
```

### 3. Setup & Inspect Consul Service Registry
Consul provides a UI to inspect the service mesh and manage configuration.
> using UI is not weak, it not just easier, but help us reduce human error üòé

1. Verify Service Registration:
Open the Consul UI at `http://localhost:8500` Navigate to the Services tab. You should see `service-a` and `service-b` listed as healthy.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbb27c7c-1ce9-4531-b7a6-3047721341b2" alt="Consul Services UI" width="700"/>
</p>
2. Set Up Centralized Configuration:
Use the Key/Value tab to store centralized configuration that your services will use, get the config in `.env-local`.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1108ce91-7836-49e1-8a03-860b8f75cae0" alt="Consul Key/Value UI" width="700"/>
</p>

### 3. Start the Application Services
```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```
when every time service is starting... it will try to migrate the migrations using `alembic`. So table that we devine in code base will also created in the database.
before you can fully use the app endpoint, insert application's data in `postgres-init\example-data.sql`
> (‚ÑπÔ∏è) DO NOT change version data in `*/app/repository/migration/versions/*.py`, if you need to change the migration follow instruction at section 'How To Modify The Code?'



### 5. Finale; Setup Your Gateway
same like consul, our Kong gateway also provide intuitive web admin UI 
first create your services, add service-a to kong i setup like below
```json
{
  "name": "pokemon-service",
  "tags": null,
  "protocol": "http",
  "host": "service-a.service.consul",
  "path": "/service-a/",
  "port": 80
}
```
do the same to service-b
```json
{
  "name": "trainer-service",
  "tags": null,
  "protocol": "http",
  "host": "service-b.service.consul",
  "path": "/service-b/",
  "port": 80
}
```

after above configuration you'll get something like below:

Next setup your route, i make every request with `/pokemons` is redirected to `service-a` aka `pokemon-service`
```json
{
  "name": "pokemon-service-route",
  "service": {
    "id": "13202838-f1b8-43f0-b541-8a15acaac2d5"
  },
  "tags": [],
  "protocols": [
    "http"
  ],
  "paths": [
    "/pokemons"
  ]
}
```

do the same to service be every request with `/trainers` is redirected to `service-b` aka `trainer-service`
```json
{
  "name": "trainer-service-route",
  "service": {
    "id": "69b874d5-0b86-4292-8b81-563d64df37a4"
  },
  "tags": [],
  "protocols": [
    "http"
  ],
  "paths": [
    "/trainers"
  ]
}
```

after above configuration you'll get something like below:

## How To Modify The Code?
0. ensure you have uv package manager installed
1. go to root project `python-fastapi-microservice/service-a/`, activate venv, sync and install all required dependency form uv.lock `uv sync`, we are using uv in this project, but keep the requirements.txt on track by exporting it

2. `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create pokemons table"` will generate app/repository/migration/versions/xxxx_xxxx_table.py. so use it when you modify or create new table. after versions file is generated, then just start the service again, the automigration will start migrating your changes

3.  run the service `python main.py`
